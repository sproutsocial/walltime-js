Contributions are welcome, thanks for taking the time to help out with the project.  Here are some general guidelines about what is expected of new code.

- White space is free, apply liberally throughout your code.
- Comments are always a plus, but not explicitly required for simple code.
- Unit tests keep everyone sane, so try to write some to cover your new code.
- Make sure all the existing unit tests pass by running `grunt test`

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet ``A System of National Time for Railroads'' (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.
# His proposal was adopted by the railroads on 1883-11-18 at 12:00,
# and the most of the country soon followed suit.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay ``An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light'' published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.
#
#	-- Robertson Davies, The diary of Samuel Marchbanks,
#	   Clarke, Irwin (1947), XIX, Sunday

# For more about the first ten years of DST in the United States, see
# Robert Garland's <a href="http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/dst.html">
# Ten years of daylight saving from the Pittsburgh standpoint
# (Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, 1927)</a>.
#
# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26
# and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up
# <a href="http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html">:
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# </a> (August 1945) by way of confirmation.

# From Joseph Gallant citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
# Paul has been careful to use the "US" rules only in those locations
# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
# U.S. government action.  So even though the "US" rules have changed
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# We generate the files specified below to guard against old files with
# obsolete information being left in the time zone binary directory.
# We limit the list to names that have appeared in previous versions of
# this time zone package.
# We do these as separate Zones rather than as Links to avoid problems if
# a particular place changes whether it observes DST.
# We put these specifications here in the northamerica file both to
# increase the chances that they'll actually get compiled and to
# avoid the need to duplicate the US rules in another file.

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# ...Alaska (and Hawaii) had the timezone names changed in 1967.
#    old			 new
#    Pacific Standard Time(PST)  -same-
#    Yukon Standard Time(YST)    -same-
#    Central Alaska S.T. (CAT)   Alaska-Hawaii St[an]dard Time (AHST)
#    Nome Standard Time (NT)     Bering Standard Time (BST)
#
# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part
#    of the Aleutian islands.   No DST.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# The tables below use `NST', not `NT', for Nome Standard Time.
# I invented `CAWT' for Central Alaska War Time.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-21):
# The above dates are for 1988.
# Note the "AKST" and "AKDT" abbreviations, the claim that there's
# no DST in Samoa, and the claim that there is DST in Alaska and the
# Aleutians.

# From Arthur David Olson (1988-02-13):
# Legal standard time zone names, from United States Code (1982 Edition and

#	(none)
#	United States standard eastern time
#	United States standard mountain time
#	United States standard central time
#	United States standard Pacific time
#	(none)
#	United States standard Alaska time

#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time

# The law doesn't give abbreviations.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08), following a heads-up from Rives McDow:
# Public law 106-564 (2000-12-23) introduced the abbreviation
# "Chamorro Standard Time" for time in Guam and the Northern Marianas.
# See the file "australasia".

# From Arthur David Olson, 2005-08-09

# From Dave Cantor (2004-11-02):
# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# <http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1>
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City
# in Russell County, Lanett in Chambers County and some towns in Lee County,
# set their watches and clocks on Eastern time."  It quotes H.H. "Bubba"
# Roberts, city administrator in Phenix City. as saying "We are in the Central
# time zone, but we do go by the Eastern time zone because so many people work
# in Columbus."
